# CONFIGURATION FILES FOR DEFAULT APPLICATIONS, CUSTOM APPLICATIONS 
# AND KEY STROKES 

*** DEFAULT APPLICATIONS *** 

# By default, FML uses programs defined in mimeapps.list 
# and defaults.list for opening applications.

# Paths to mimeapps.list and defaults.list:

# MIMEAPPSLIST = ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
# MIMEAPPSLIST = /usr/local/share/applications/mimeapps.list
DEFLIST = /usr/share/applications/defaults.list

# Default program for any other text file types 
default = gedit

*** CUSTOM APPLICATIONS ***

# You can also specify your own way for opening files with
# certain extensions.

# Usage: 
# .fileextension = programname flags <FILE> postconditions 
# Please use <FILE> (literally) in place of name of the file
# you wish to open.

# eg.    .txt = gedit <FILE>
# eg.    .pdf = evince --page-index=2 <FILE>

.txt = gnome-terminal -e 'vi <FILE>'
.py = subl <FILE>
